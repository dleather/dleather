# Hello, I‚Äôm David Leather üëã

I‚Äôm a **Quantitative Researhcer and Economist** with a passion for **high-performance computing**, **scientific research**, and **data-driven solutions**. Over the past ten years, I‚Äôve honed my skills in **Julia, Python, MATLAB, and C++ (begginner)**‚Äîdeveloping efficient, scalable code that tackles complex computational challenges.

My goal is to leverage my expertise in time-series econometrics, numerical methods, algorithm optimization, and data analysis‚Äîgrounded in deep domain knowledge of economics, macroeconomics, finance and real estate markets‚Äîto drive impactful projects that require robust, high-performance solutions. I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams and leveraging open-source technologies to develop scalable, data-driven solutions that drive business impact, enhance decision-making, and optimize complex systems.
